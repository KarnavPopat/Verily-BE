<div>This is the second paragraph and article body of a good article, lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
Slowly, evenly, Haled let his breath out. His palms were sweaty, just like that day in the field behind Tala's, and he felt even less hopeful. The sun, already high in the sky, shone through his eyelids, and he knew it was time to meet his maker. His heart threatening to rip through his chest, he got up, slowly, carefully.
Looking around, he saw much, and he saw little. Men and women in dusty leather and rusty mail were buzzing around like flies, to the tune of veterans and captains alike screaming orders and insults. Children rushed to keep up with their mothers, while greybeards looked solemnly at each other and warily at the blazing sun. The ground was dry, drier than Haled had ever seen it except on that day, and today he did not have the luxury of a waterskin; under his breath, he cursed himself for knocking it over the night before. He had slept too long, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to go wandering around looking for water so close to noon.
The camp of Gilead's proud and mighty force was a camp of extremes, and everyone knew it; there were far too many boys, but far too few men; far too many soldiers (or so they called themselves) filling the air with the stink of crowds, but far too few swords, far too little steel to fill the sky with its bright gleam. In the camp outside Gilead, there was too much fear, and not enough of those who could command it. It smelt like death.
It was easy to see why, of course. Haled turned his smarting eyes from the morning sun and looked uneasily to the west, where the forest used to stand, to the fluttering pennants bright as blood, to the clanking engines of war and to the camp of the Seven Sinners. He wouldn’t have been surprised to see vultures circling around overhead; even the slowest bird knew that carrion was plentiful wherever the jet-black flag flew.
Haled’s long, piercing gaze (he thought to himself), was cut short by a shout to his right. Haled turned again, holding up an arm to shield his eyes from the sun, and saw Deounara. She was smiling calmly, seemingly unaffected by the stink of feces and fear that filled the air. Haled sighed, bracing himself as he covered the distance between them with long, powerful strides (the dreadful anticipation was seemingly bringing out the fanciful side of him).
“Scared, my lady?”
Haled smiled, but couldn’t think of an appropriate retort beyond mumbling, 
“Not as much as you, sirrah.”
Deounara laughed politely but brightly, causing a nearby child to look up from the helm she was hammering at, before stopping to take in Haled’s sorry state.
“My, the night has not been easy on you, has it?”
Haled shook his head ruefully. The sweat-drenched shirt of boiled leather that he had awkwardly slept in clung to his back, and his stomach was heavy with a deep dread. He could scarce bear to imagine how pitiable he looked. Returning Deounara’s stare, he was unsurprised to find that she was considerably less discomfited. Her jerkin hung comfortably from her shoulders, and her golden-brown hair flowed neatly from under a small hair-wrap.
Looking around vaguely, Haled replied, “Sleep didn’t come easy, but I’m no worse than yesterday.” He paused, then added, “But I see you continue to be completely undaunted by the prospect of a gruesome, meaningless death.”
Deounara grinned. “Aye, I couldn’t sleep either, so a few of us brave-hearts hooked a cask from the mess test. Renard” – she scrunched her face – “was not pleased.”
Searching for something to say, Haled’s thoughts turned back to the distant camp that threw an ominous (and metaphorical) shadow over them all. “Any news from that lot?” Haled asked, jerking his head vaguely toward the west.
Deounara shook her head, but though she tried to keep up a carefree smile, Haled saw an apprehension in her eyes that wasn’t there before. “There was a din in the middle of the night – which obviously didn’t interrupt your nightmares – but nobody knows anything about it and nobody’s come over to enlighten us. As far as I know, the ba – the fight’s still on.”
“Ah”, Haled muttered. His palms were sweaty again, but he had resigned himself to his fate. Every man had to die, and Haled would rather meet his fate with defiance in his eyes and his home at his back than sweating and palsied, a long-lived coward.
“Oh don’t be such a pill”, Deonara responded, the message somewhat undercut by the fear still visible in her eyes. “We number more than them, and we’ve been fortifying this damned pass for a fortnight now.”
Thinking it best to soldier on, Haled interjected, “So, midday?”
“Noon, aye. Have you finally reconsidered?”
Haled shook his head, but his mind had already wandered to the accursed hour barrelling towards them. Muttering something about waterskins and whetstones, he drifted off and made his way through the frenzied crowd, heading to the other side of the camp. Though Deonara – as well the rest of his childhood friends – had been trying to dissuade him, he had decided, as soon as the enemy had been sighted from Gilead’s walls, that he wanted to fight at the front.
As he came within sight of the banners and battle-marked shields that marked the veteran soldiers from the armed farmers, he spotted Sir Morhault, the grizzled commander who had been assigned to him. Before Haled could even open his mouth, he was met with Sir Morhault’s typical mock enthusiasm.
“Oh hello, our suicidal hero’s decided to join us! Has your highness made like a chicken yet?”
Haled knew better than to answer, so the senior dropped the act and continued, “Suit yourself, manure boy. Get your shield, get in line, and resist the urge to charge heroically into the pointy things.”
